TODO (backend):
App.js (line 150)
App.js (line 218)

**
SPECIAL NOTE
To debug and seen functionalities btw admin and student, change line 220 to the ffg
Admin user: const user = users.filter((user) => user.id === 1)
Normal user: const user = users.filter((user) => user.id === 2)

This part should be changed totally to get current user from the session. (i.e. logged in user)

installation instructions
NOTE
> dummy server implemented
> all data is fetched in the App.js file. This should be the only file to be edited to use APIs, etc. 
> edit only the places with localhost links (lines 46, 67, 92, 112, 145, 154), except where otherwise stated. Please check TODOs and read comments in the code
> these have been put there to help guide and to help u avoid spending a lot of time understanding the code
> db.json serves as the dummy data. and a dummy server was set up to use this dummy data.
> feel free to make changes

1. clone the repo
2. run npm start
3. run dummy server (npm run server)
4. the dummy server must be automatically installed when you run the code, but if it doesn`t (i.e. step 2 does not work), here are the steps:
	* run npm install json-server
	* line 22 of package.json file has: "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 5000". this means the dummy backend is served at port 5000
	* you can change the port if you want. But dont change anything else. If you want anyother dummy db, u can remove db.json and change it to 
	* new dummy db (e.g. db2.json. There is no point for this though).
	* run the server (step 3)
	* you can visit http://localhost/users to see the users data in the browser
